Hi Anshul,
 
I am happy to let you know that your application has been shortlisted for the next round of evaluation. As a next step, I would like you to attempt the following assignment-
 
-----
Design and develop a web application (in PHP), which will be an internship portal similar to that of Internshala, but on a much smaller scale. 
 
- The application will have 2 kinds of users, student and employer.
- After registering, the employer should be able to post internship, with bare minimum details. Internship posting should be restricted only to an employer and a student as well as a non registered user, should not be allowed.
- There should be a page which should display all the internship being posted on the application. This page should be accessible to everyone irrespective of whether the user is even logged in.
- A student should be able to apply to any internship he may want. If the student has already applied for an internship, he should be restricted from applying again. If the user is not logged in, it should redirect to the login page. And if the user is logged in as an employer, he should not be allowed to apply.
- The employer should be able to see all the application he has received for his internships.

Mainly, we want you to concentrate on the following things:
 
- Database design
- Good coding practices
- Very basic decent design
 
Deadline: 13th March (Sunday) 5:00 PM
